# Contributing to Runhouse
Please file an [issue](https://github.com/run-house/runhouse/issues) if you encounter a bug.

If you would like to submit a bug-fix or improve an existing feature, please submit a pull request following the
process outlined below.

If you would like to contribute, but don't know what to add, you can look for open issues labeled
`good first issue`, or take a look at the [funhouse repo](https://github.com/run-house/funhouse) to
create and add your own ML application using Runhouse!

## Development Process
If you want to modify code, please follow the instructions for creating a Pull Request.

1. Fork the Github repository, and then clone the forked repo to local.
```
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/runhouse.git
cd runhouse
git remote add upstream https://github.com/run-house/runhouse.git
```

2. Create a new branch for your development changes:
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```

3. Install Runhouse
```
pip install -e .
```

4. Develop your features

5. Download and run pre-commit to automatically format your code using black and ruff.

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run --files [FILES [FILES ...]]
```

6. Add, commit, and push your changes. Create a "Pull Request" on GitHub to submit the changes for review.

```
git push -u origin branch-name
```

## Documentation
Docs source code is located in `docs/`. To build and review docs locally:

```

cd docs/
make clean html
```

If updating or adding a notebook or colab file, please follow the following steps:

* export the notebook into a `.ipynb` file (`notebook_name.ipynb`), and add/update the notebook file under `docs/notebooks`, either in the `api` or `examples` folder
* To construct the `.rst` file corresponding to the notebook text and output, run from the runhouse git root:
```
scripts/docs/convert_nb_to_rst.sh docs/notebooks/xxx/notebook_name.ipynb
```
* push changes to both the `.ipynb` and `.rst` files
