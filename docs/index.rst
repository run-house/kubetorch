Runhouse enables rapid, cost-effective machine learning development.

With Runhouse, your ML code executes "serverlessly." Dispatch Python functions and classes to any of your own cloud compute infrastructure, and call them
eagerly as if they were local. This means:

#. You can natively run and debug your code on remote GPUs or other powerful infra, like Ray, Spark, or Kubernetes, from your local IDE.
#. This code then runs as-is in CI/CD or production, with no research-to-production delays, where the underlying code will be identically dispatched and executed on ephemeral Runhouse clusters.
#. Hardware requirements and environment is captured in code and you gain fine-grained control to more efficiently bin pack jobs and utilize multiple clusters or even cluods.
