# # Launch DeepSeek-R1 on Your Own Cloud Account
# DeepSeek-R1 32B distill is a smaller yet still powerful distillation of the DeepSeek R1 model.
# The performance of the Qwen-32B is roughly comparable across many tasks to o1-mini, with
# the obvious advantage of being able to run within your own cloud.
#
# The best part is that we can run inference over an un-quantized version with vLLM using
# 4 x L4 GPUs. These are very available on AWS and GCP (A10 is a good sub on Azure), as well as
# most vertical GPU cloud providers, and the spot price is just $1/hour.
#
# We can easily add additional nodes and additional GPUs, and using vLLM to increase
# tensor and pipeline parallelism.
#
# Note, there must be a remote machine with Kubetorch running, and you need a Kubeconfig locally.
# Assuming that's the case, you simply need to install Kubetorch and the vllm package:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "kubetorch" torch vllm
# ```
#
# We'll be downloading the model from Hugging Face, so we may need to set up our Hugging Face token:
# ```shell
# $ export HF_TOKEN=<your huggingface token>
# ```


# ## Defining the vLLM Inference Class
# We define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# This is regular, undecorated Python code, that implements methods to
# load the model (automatically downloading from HuggingFace), and to generate text from a prompt.

# Now we will define compute using Kubetorch and send our inference class to the remote compute.
# First, we define an image with torch and vllm and 8 x L4 with 1 node.
# Then, we send our inference class to the remote compute and instantiate a the remote inference class
# with the name `deepseek` which we can access by name later. Finally, we call the remote inference class
# as if it were local to generate text from a list of prompts and print the results. If you launch with multiple nodes
# you can take advantage of vllm's parallelism.

Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules: If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral. If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM). Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form. Given an integer, write Python code to convert it to a Roman numeral.",
