## 👵 Welcome Home!
PyTorch lets you send a model or tensor `.to(device)`, so
why can't you do `my_fn.to('a_gcp_a100')` or `my_table.to('parquet_in_s3')`?
Runhouse allows just that: send code and data to any of your compute or
data infra (with your own cloud creds), all in Python, and continue to use them
eagerly exactly as they were.

Runhouse is for ML Researchers, Engineers, and Data Scientists who are tired of:
 - 🚜 manually shuttling code and data around between their local machine, remote instances, and cloud storage,
 - 📤📥 constantly spinning up and down boxes,
 - 🐜 debugging over ssh and notebook tunnels,
 - 🧑‍🔧 translating their code into a pipeline DSL just to use multiple hardware types,
 - 🪦 debugging in an orchestrator,
 - 👩‍✈️ missing out on fancy LLM IDE features,
 - 🕵️ and struggling to find their teammates' code and data artifacts.

By way of a visual,

Take a look at this code (adapted from our first [tutorial](https://github.com/run-house/tutorials/tree/main/t01_Stable_Diffusion)):

```python
import runhouse as rh
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch


def sd_generate(prompt, num_images=1, steps=100, guidance_scale=7.5, model_id='stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base'):
    pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16, revision='fp16').to('cuda')
    return pipe([prompt] * num_images, num_inference_steps=steps, guidance_scale=guidance_scale).images


if __name__ == "__main__":
    gpu = rh.cluster(name='rh-v100', instance_type='V100:1', provider='gcp')
    generate_gpu = rh.function(fn=sd_generate).to(gpu, env=['./', 'torch==1.12.0', 'diffusers'])

    images = generate_gpu('A digital illustration of a woman running on the roof of a house.', num_images=2, steps=50)
    [image.show() for image in images]

    generate_gpu.save(name='sd_generate')
```
By saving, I or anyone I share with can load and call into this service with a single line of code, from anywhere
with a Python interpreter and internet connection (notebook, IDE, CI/CD, orchestrator node, etc.):
```python
generate_gpu = rh.function(name='sd_generate')
images = generate_gpu("A hot dog made of matcha.")
```
There's no magic yaml, DSL, code serialization, or "submitting for execution." We're
just spinning up the cluster for you (or using an existing cluster), syncing over your code,
starting a gRPC connection, and running your code on the cluster.

**_Runhouse does things for you that you'd spend time doing yourself, in as obvious a way as possible._**

And because it's not stateless, we can pin the model to GPU memory, and get ~1.5s/image
inference before any compilation.

On the data side, we can do things like:

```python
# Send a folder up to a cluster (rsync)
rh.folder(path=input_images_dir).to(system=gpu, path="dreambooth/instance_images")

# This goes directly cluster-> s3, doesn't bounce to local
outputs_s3 = rh.folder(system=gpu, path="dreambooth/outputs").to("s3", path="runhouse/dreambooth/outputs")
outputs_s3.save("dreambooth_outputs")

# and later:
rh.folder(name="dreambooth_outputs").to("here")

# Load a table in from anywhere (S3, GCS, local, etc)
my_table = rh.table(system="gcs", path="my_bucket/my_table.parquet").to("here")
# preprocess...

gcs_ds = rh.table(preprocessed_dataset).to("gcs", path="my_bucket/preprocessed_table.parquet")
gcs_ds.save("preprocessed-tokenized-dataset")

# later, on another machine:
preprocessed_table = rh.table(name="preprocessed-tokenized-dataset")
for batch in preprocessed_table.stream(batch_size=batch_size):
    ...

# Send a model checkpoint up to blob storage
trained_model = rh.blob(data=pickle.dumps(model))
trained_model.to("s3", path="runhouse/my_bucket").save(name="yelp_fine_tuned_bert")
```

These APIs work from anywhere with a Python interpreter and an internet connection,
so notebooks, scripts, pipeline DSLs, etc. are all fair game. We currently support AWS,
GCP, Azure, and Lambda Labs credentials through SkyPilot, as well as BYO cluster (just drop
in an ip address and ssh key).

## 🚨 This is an Alpha 🚨

Runhouse is heavily under development and we expect to iterate
on the APIs before reaching beta (version 0.1.0).

## 🐣 Getting Started

tldr;
```commandline
pip install runhouse
# Or "runhouse[aws]", "runhouse[gcp]", "runhouse[azure]", "runhouse[all]"
sky check
# Optionally, for portability (e.g. Colab):
runhouse login
```

### 🔌 Installation

⚠️ On Apple M1 or M2 machines ⚠️, you will need to install grpcio with conda
before you install Runhouse - more specifically, before you install Ray.
If you already have Ray installed, you can skip this.
[See here](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-overview/installation.html#m1-mac-apple-silicon-support)
for how to install grpc properly on Apple silicon. You'll only know if you did
this correctly if you run `ray.init()` in a Python interpreter. If you're
having trouble with this, let us know.

Runhouse can be installed with:
```
pip install runhouse
```

Depending on which cloud providers you plan to use, you can also install the following
additional dependencies (to install the right versions of tools like boto, gsutil, etc.):
```commandline
pip install "runhouse[aws]"
pip install "runhouse[gcp]"
pip install "runhouse[azure]"
# Or
pip install "runhouse[all]"
```

As this is an alpha, we push feature updates every few weeks as new microversions.

### ✈️ Verifying your Cloud Setup with SkyPilot

Runhouse supports both BYO cluster, where you interact with existing compute via their
IP address and SSH key, and autoscaled clusters, where we spin up and down cloud instances
in your own cloud account for you. If you only plan to use BYO clusters, you can
disregard the following.

Runhouse uses [SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
much of the heavy lifting with launching and terminating cloud instances.
We love it and you should [throw them a Github star ⭐️](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/).

To verify that your cloud credentials are set up correctly for autoscaling, run
```
sky check
```
in your command line. This will confirm which cloud providers are ready to
use, and will give detailed instructions if any setup is incomplete. SkyPilot also
provides an excellent suite of CLI commands for basic instance management operations.
There are a few that you'll be reaching for frequently when using Runhouse with autoscaling
that you should familiarize yourself with,
[here](https://runhouse-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/overview/compute.html#on-demand-clusters).

### 🔒 Creating a Runhouse Account for Secrets and Portability

Using Runhouse with only the OSS Python package is perfectly fine. However,
you can unlock some unique portability features by creating an (always free)
account on [api.run.house](https://api.run.house) and saving your secrets and/or
resource metadata there. For example, you can open a Google Colab, call `runhouse login`,
and all of your secrets or resources will be ready to use there with no additional setup.
Think of the OSS-package-only experience as akin to Microsoft Office,
while creating an account will make your cloud resources sharable and accessible
from anywhere like Google Docs. You
can see examples of this portability in the
[Runhouse Tutorials](https://github.com/run-house/tutorials).

To create an account, visit [api.run.house](https://api.run.house),
or simply call `runhouse login` from the command line (or
`rh.login()` from Python).

> **Note**:
These portability features only ever store light metadata about your resources
(e.g. my_folder_name -> [provider, bucket, path]) on our API servers. All the actual data and compute
stays inside your own cloud account and never hits our servers. The Secrets service stores
your secrets in Hashicorp Vault (an industry standard for secrets management), and our secrets
APIs simply call Vault's APIs. We never store secrets on our API servers. We plan to add
support for BYO secrets management shortly. Let us know if you need it and which system you use.
