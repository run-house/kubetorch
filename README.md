## 👵 Welcome Home!

Runhouse is a unified interface into *existing* compute and data systems, built to reclaim
the 50-75% of ML practitioners' time lost to debugging, adapting, or repackaging code
for different environments.

### 🤨 Who is this for?

* 🦸‍♀️ **OSS maintainers** who want to improve the accessibility, reproducibility, and reach of their code,
without having to build support or examples for every cloud or compute system (e.g. Kubernetes) one by one.
   * See this in action in 🤗 Hugging Face ([Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/README.md#running-the-examples-on-remote-hardware-with-auto-setup), [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/blob/main/examples/README.md#simple-multi-gpu-hardware-launcher)) and 🦜🔗 [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/runhouse.html)
* 👩‍🔬 **ML Researchers and Data Scientists** who don't want to spend or wait 3-6 months translating and packaging
their work for production.
* 👩‍🏭 **ML Engineers** who want to be able to update and improve production services, pipelines, and artifacts with a
Pythonic, debuggable devX.
* 👩‍🔧 **ML Platform teams** who want a versioned, shared, maintainable stack of services and data artifacts that
research and production pipelines both depend on.

### 🦾 How does it work?

_"Learn once, run anywhere"_

Runhouse is like **PyTorch + Terraform + Google Drive.**

1. Just as **PyTorch** lets you send a model or tensor `.to(device)`, Runhouse OSS
lets you do `my_fn.to('gcp_a100')` or `my_table.to('s3')`: send functions and data to any of your compute or
data infra, all in Python, and continue to interact with them eagerly (there's no DAG) from your existing code and
environment. Think of it as an expansion pack to Python that lets it take detours to remote
machines or manipulate remote data.
2. Just as **Terraform** is a unified language for creation and destruction of infra, the
Runhouse APIs are a unified interface into existing compute and data systems.
See what we already support and what's on the [roadmap, below](#supported-infra).
3. Runhouse resources can be shared across environments or teams, providing a **Google Drive**-like
layer for accessibility, visibility, and management across all your infra and providers.

This allows you to:
* Call your preprocessing, training, and inference each on different hardware from
inside a single notebook or script
* Slot that script into a single orchestrator node rather than translate it into an ML pipeline DAG of Docker images
* Share any of those services or data artifacts with your team instantly, and update them over time

It wraps industry-standard tooling like Ray and the Cloud SDKs (boto, gsutil, etc. via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/))
to give you production-quality features like queuing, distributed, async, logging,
low latency, hardware efficiency, auto-launching, and auto-termination out of the box.

### 👩‍💻 Enough chitchat, just show me the code

Here is **all the code you need** to stand up a stable diffusion inference service on
a fresh cloud GPU.


```python
import runhouse as rh
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

def sd_generate(prompt):
    model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base").to("cuda")
    return model(prompt).images[0]

gpu = rh.ondemand_cluster(name="my-a100", instance_type="A100:1").up_if_not()
sd_generate = rh.function(sd_generate).to(gpu, env=["torch", "diffusers"])

# the following runs on our remote A100 gpu
sd_generate("An oil painting of Keanu Reeves eating a sandwich.").show()
sd_generate.save(name="sd_generate")
```

On the data side, sync folders, tables, or blobs between local, clusters, and file storage. All
this is done without bouncing off the laptop.

```python
import runhouse as rh

folder_on_gpu = rh.folder(path="./instance_images").to(gpu, path="dreambooth/instance_images")

folder_on_s3 = folder_on_gpu.to("s3", path="dreambooth/instance_images")
folder_on_s3.save("dreambooth_outputs")
```

Reuse your saved compute and data resources from anywhere, with a single line of Python.

```python
sd_generate = rh.function(name="sd_generate")
image = sd_generate("A hot dog made of matcha.")

folder_on_s3 = rh.folder(name="dreambooth_outputs")
folder_on_local = folder_on_s3.to("here")
```

These APIs work from anywhere with a Python interpreter and an internet connection.
Notebooks, scripts, pipeline nodes, etc. are all fair game.

### 🙅‍♀️ Runhouse is not

* An orchestrator / scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Metaflow)
* A distributed compute DSL (Ray, Spark, Dask)
* An ML Platform (Sagemaker, Vertex, Azure ML)
* A model registry / experiment manager / MLOps framework (MLFlow, WNB, Kubeflow)
* Hosted compute (Modal, Banana, Replicate)

## 🐣 Getting Started

Please see the [Getting Started guide](https://www.run.house/docs/tutorials/quick_start).

tldr;
```commandline
pip install runhouse
# Or "runhouse[aws]", "runhouse[gcp]", "runhouse[azure]", "runhouse[sagemaker]", "runhouse[all]"

# [optional] to set up cloud provider secrets:
sky check

# [optional] login for portability:
runhouse login
```

## 🔒 Creating a Runhouse Account for Secrets and Portability

You can unlock some unique portability features by creating an (always free)
[account](https://www.run.house) and saving your secrets and resource metadata there.
Log in from anywhere to access all previously saved secrets and resources, ready to be used with with
no additional setup.

To log in, run `runhouse login` from the command line, or
`rh.login()` from Python.

> **Note**:
Secrets are stored in Hashicorp Vault (an industry standard for secrets management), and our APIs simply call Vault's APIs. We only ever store light metadata about your resources
(e.g. my_folder_name -> [provider, bucket, path]) on our API servers, while all actual data and compute
stays inside your own cloud account and never hits our servers. We plan to
add support for BYO secrets management shortly. Let us know if you need it and which system you use.
